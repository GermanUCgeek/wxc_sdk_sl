  Webex Calling Detailed Call History:
    doc: 'The base URL for these APIs is analytics.webexapis.com (or analytics-f.webex.com
      for Government), which does not work with the API reference''s Try It feature.
      If you have any questions or need help please contact the Webex Developer Support
      team at devsupport@webex.com.

      To retrieve Detailed Call History information, you must use a token with the
      spark-admin:calling_cdr_read scope. The authenticating user must be a read-only-admin
      or full-admin of the organization and have the administrator role "Webex Calling
      Detailed Call History API access" enabled.

      Detailed Call History information is available 5 minutes after a call has ended
      and may be retrieved for up to 48 hours. For example, if a call ends at 9:46
      am, the record for that call can be collected using the API from 9:51 am, and
      is available until 9:46 am two days later.

      This API is rate-limited to one call every 5 minutes for a given organization
      ID.

      Details on the fields returned from this API and their potential values are
      available at https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nmug598/Reports-for-Your-Cloud-Collaboration-Portfolio
      under the section Detailed Call History.'

        The API will return all reports that were created between startTime and endTime.


        Response entries may be added as more information is made available for the
        reports.
