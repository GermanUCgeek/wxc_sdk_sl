      Call queues temporarily hold calls in the cloud when all agents, which

      can be users or agents, assigned to receive calls from the queue are

      unavailable. Queued calls are routed to an available agent when not on an

      active call. Each call queue is assigned a Lead Number, which is a telephone

      number outside callers can dial to reach users assigned to the call queue.

      Call queues are also assigned an internal extension, which can be dialed

      internally to reach users assigned to the call queue.

      Call queues temporarily hold calls in the cloud when all agents, which

      can be users or agents, assigned to receive calls from the queue are

      unavailable. Queued calls are routed to an available agent when not on an

      active call. Each call queue is assigned a Lead Number, which is a telephone

      number outside callers can dial to reach users assigned to the call queue.

      Call queues are also assigned an internal extension, which can be dialed

      internally to reach users assigned to the call queue.

      Updating a call queue requires a full administrator auth token with a scope
      of spark-admin:telephony_config_write.'

      Performs bulk and asynchronous processing for all types of device settings initiated

  - doc: 'Retrieves Workspace''s Call Intercept Settings

      The intercept feature gracefully takes a workspace''s phone out of service,
      while providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing
      options. Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming
      calls to the specified workspace are intercepted. Also depending on the service
      configuration, outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

      This API requires a full or read-only administrator auth token with a scope
      of spark-admin:workspaces_read or a user auth token with spark:workspaces_read
      scope can be used to read workspace settings.'

  - doc: 'Configures a Workspace''s Call Intercept Settings

      The intercept feature gracefully takes a workspace''s phone out of service,
      while providing callers with informative announcements and alternative routing
      options. Depending on the service configuration, none, some, or all incoming
      calls to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service
      configuration, outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

      This API requires a full or read-only administrator auth token with a scope
      of spark-admin:workspaces_write or a user auth token with spark:workspaces_read
      scope can be used by a person to read their settings.'
