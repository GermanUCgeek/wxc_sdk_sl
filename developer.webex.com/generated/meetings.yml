  Meeting Chats:
    doc: 'Chats are content captured in a meeting when chat messages are sent between
      the participants within a meeting. This feature allows a Compliance Officer
      to access the in-meeting chat content.

      The Compliance Officer can use the Meeting Chats API to retrieve the chats of
      a meeting and to delete all chats associated with a meeting. private chats are
      text messages between two people. group chats are for larger breakout spaces.
      Meeting chats are different from room messages in that there is no catch-up
      propagation. For example, if a user joins a meeting late only, chat messages
      that are created from then on, will be propagated to this user. To understand
      which user saw which message if they joined late, you have to query the meetingParticipants
      REST resource for the joined/left times and compare to the meetingsChat chatTime
      field.

      The Webex meetings chat functionality and API endpoint described here is "upon-request"
      and not enabled by default. If you need it enabled for your org, or if you need
      help, please contact the Webex Developer Support team at devsupport@webex.com.'

  Meeting Closed Captions:
    doc: 'Meeting Closed Captions APIs are enabled upon request, and are not available
      by default. Please contact the Webex Developer Support team at devsupport@webex.com
      if you would like to enable this feature for your organization.

      Meeting closed captions are the automatic transcriptions of what is being said
      during a meeting in real-time. Closed captions appear after being enabled during
      a meeting and can be translated to a participant''s language.

      A closed caption snippet is a short text snippet from a meeting closed caption
      which was spoken by a particular participant in the meeting. A meeting''s closed
      captions consists of many snippets.

      The Closed Captions API manages meeting closed captions and snippets. You can
      list meeting closed captions, as well as list and download snippets. Closed
      captions can  be retrieved in either Web Video Text Tracks (VTT) or plain text
      (TXT) format via the download links provided by the vttDownloadLink and txtDownloadlink
      response properties, respectively.

      Refer to the Meetings API Scopes section of Meetings Overview guide for the
      scopes required for each API.

      Notes:

      Currently, closed caption APIs are only supported for the Compliance Officer
      role.

      Closed captions will be available 15 minutes after the meeting is finished.'

  Meeting Transcripts:
    doc: 'Not supported for Webex for Government (FedRAMP)

      A meeting transcript is the automatic transcription of a meeting''s recordings
      by our industry-leading speech-to-text engine to capture of what was discussed
      and decided during the meeting, in text form.

      A transcript snippet is a short text snippet from a meeting transcript which
      was spoken by a particular participant in the meeting. A meeting transcript
      consists of many snippets.

      This API manages meeting transcripts and snippets. You can use the Transcript
      API to list meeting transcripts, list, get and update transcript snippets. Transcripts
      may be retrieved via download link defined by vttDownloadLink or txtDownloadlink
      in the response body.

      Refer to the Meetings API Scopes section of Meetings Overview for scopes required
      for each API.

            Please note that when a meeting is being scheduled, start of the meeting

        Each scheduled meeting or meeting instance of a meeting series has its own
        start, end, etc. Thus, for example, when a daily meeting has been scheduled
        from 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-10, there are 10 scheduled meeting instances in
        this series, one instance for each day, and each one has its own attributes.
        When a scheduled meeting has been started and ended or is happening, there
        are even more ended or in-progress meeting instances.

        Use this operation to list scheduled meeting and meeting instances of a meeting
        series within a specific date range.

            as the current time, start will be adjusted to the upcoming minute; otherwise,
            start will be adjusted with seconds and milliseconds stripped off. For
            instance, if the current time is 2022-03-01T10:32:16.657+08:00, start

            as the current time, start will be adjusted to the upcoming minute; otherwise,
            start will be adjusted with seconds and milliseconds stripped off. For
            instance, if the current time is 2022-03-01T10:32:16.657+08:00, start

        Specify the person ID in the personId parameter in the URI. Only an admin
        can update a person details.

        Include all details for the person. This action expects all user details to
        be present in the request. A common approach is to first GET the person''s
        details, make changes, then PUT both the changed and unchanged values.

        Admin users can include Webex Calling (BroadCloud) user details in the response
        by specifying callingData parameter as true.

        Note: The locationId can only be set when adding a calling license to a user.
        It cannot be changed if a user is already an existing calling user.

        When doing attendee management, to update a user from host role to an attendee
        for a site append #attendee to the respective siteUrl and remove the meeting
        host license for this site from the license array.

        To update a person from an attendee role to a host for a site, add the meeting
        license for this site in the meeting array, and remove that site from the
        siteurl parameter.

        To remove the attendee privilege for a user on a meeting site, remove the
        sitename#attendee from the siteUrls array. The showAllTypes parameter must
        be set to true.'

      available for Webhooks: meetings, recordings, meetingParticipants, and meetingTranscripts.

      Webhooks allow your app to be notified via HTTP when a specific event occurs
      in Webex. For example, your app can register a webhook to be notified when a
      new message is posted into a specific room.

      Events trigger in near real-time allowing your app and backend IT systems to
      stay in sync with new content and room activity.

      Check The Webhooks Guide and our blog regularly for announcements of additional
      webhook resources and event types.
