    Beta Workspace Call Settings with Department Features
    
    Workspaces represent places where people work, such as conference rooms, meeting spaces, lobbies, and lunchrooms.
    Devices may be associated with workspaces.
    
    Webex Calling Workspace Settings support reading and writing of Webex Calling settings for a specific workspace
    within the organization.
    
    Viewing the list of settings in a workspace /v1/workspaces API requires an full, device, or read-only administrator
    auth token with the `spark-admin:workspaces_read` scope.
    
    Adding, updating, or deleting settings in a workspace /v1/workspaces API requires an full or device administrator
    auth token with the `spark-admin:workspaces_write` scope.
    
    This API can also be used by partner administrators acting as administrators of a different organization than their
    own. In those cases, an `orgId` must be supplied, as indicated in the reference documentation for the relevant
    endpoints.
